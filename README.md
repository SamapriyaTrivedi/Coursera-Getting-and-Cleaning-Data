# Coursera - Getting and Cleaning-Data

## Course Description
This course is offered by Johns Hopkins University which covers the basic ways that data can be obtained. The course also covers how to obtain data from the web, from APIs, from databases and from colleagues in various formats. It also covers the basics of data cleaning and how to make data “tidy”. Tidy data dramatically speed downstream data analysis tasks. The course covers the components of a complete data set including raw data, processing instructions, codebooks, and processed data.

## Assignment Problem
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

## Files in the repository

- CodeBook.md - It describes the variables, the data, and any work that are performed to clean up the data.

- run_analysis.R - It contains all the coding for doing the course project, that includes downloading and unzipping the dataset that is used for this project.

- tidydata.txt - It is a written out text file from run_analysis.R, which is the average features of each subject and each activity. Please refer to CodeBook.md. for more explicit information.
